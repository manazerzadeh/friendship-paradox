# Observing the Effect of Network Growth Model on the Friendship Paradox Phenomenon
In this study, the widely known Friendship Paradox is studied in the context of two main network growth models, the Uniform Random model and the Preferential Attachment model, and the dynamics of the interaction of the nodes within the network. This helps in understanding and modeling the effect of different variables on this phenomenon and as a result, engineering ways to predict wanted outcomes from the dynamics of the models.
